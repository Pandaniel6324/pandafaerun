(Counts as a Monk Weapon)
 Damage: 1d6 slashing (melee) / 1d6 slashing (ranged, 15/30 feet)

The Writhing Chains can function as both melee and ranged weapons.
Melee: Used as short blades or handles for close-quarters combat.
Ranged: You can use the chains as whips or to attack enemies at a distance (15 feet normal range, 30 feet with disadvantage).

Retractable Storage:
When the weapon is not in use, the chains wrap snugly around your wrists or forearms.
While stored, you are considered unarmed for Monk abilities (e.g., Martial Arts). 

Chain Mastery:
Once per turn, when you successfully hit a creature with a ranged attack using the chains, if they are up to one size larger than you, they can make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (DMs discretion). On a fail, you can pull yourself 10 feet closer to the target or pull the target 10 feet closer to you.

You gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to climb, or perform stunts involving the chains.
