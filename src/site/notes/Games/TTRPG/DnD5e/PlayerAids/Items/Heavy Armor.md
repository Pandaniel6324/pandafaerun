Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.  
  
Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your [[https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability Scores?expansion=0#toc_20\|https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability Scores?expansion=0#toc_20]] to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.  
  
[[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Items/Ring Mail\|Ring Mail]] This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can’t afford better armor.  
  
[[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Items/Chain Mail\|Chain Mail]] Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.  
  
[[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Items/Splint (Armor)\|Splint (Armor)]] This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.  
  
[[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Items/Plate (Armor)\|Plate (Armor)]] Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.
