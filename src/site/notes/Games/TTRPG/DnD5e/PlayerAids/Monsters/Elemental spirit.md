# Description**

A summoner calls forth an elemental spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Elemental Spirit stat block. When the spell is cast, the caster chooses an element: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. The creature resembles a bipedal form wreathed in the chosen element, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to the caster and their companions. In combat, the creature shares their nitiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after theirs. It obeys their verbal commands (no action required by them). If they don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.
