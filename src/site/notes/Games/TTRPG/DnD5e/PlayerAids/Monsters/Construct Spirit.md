# Traits

**_Heated Body (Metal Only)._** A creature that touches the construct or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 1d10 fire damage.

**_Stony Lethargy (Stone Only)._** When a creature the construct can see starts its turn within 10 feet of the construct, the construct can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target can’t use reactions and its speed is halved until the start of its next turn.

# Actions

**_Multiattack._** The construct makes a number of attacks equal to half this spell’s level (rounded down).

**_Slam._** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 1d8 + 4 + the spell’s level bludgeoning damage.

# Reactions

**_Berserk Lashing (Clay Only)._** When the construct takes damage, it makes a slam attack against a random creature within 5 feet of it. If no creature is within reach, the construct moves up to half its speed toward an enemy it can see, without provoking opportunity attacks.
