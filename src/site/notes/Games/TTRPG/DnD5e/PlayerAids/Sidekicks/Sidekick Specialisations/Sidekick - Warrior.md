A Warrior sidekick grows in martial prowess as it fights by your side. It might be a soldier, a town guard, a battle-trained beast, or any other creature honed for combat.

### Bonus Proficiencies

_1st-level Warrior feature_

The sidekick gains proficiency in one saving throw of your choice: Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

In addition, the sidekick gains proficiency in two skills of your choice from the following list: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival.

The sidekick gains proficiency with all armor, and if it is a humanoid or has a simple or martial weapon in its stat block, it gains proficiency with shields and all simple and martial weapons.

### Martial Role

_1st-level Warrior feature_

Each warrior focuses on offense or defense in their training. Choose one of the following options:

**Attacker.** The sidekick gains a +2 bonus to all attack rolls.

**Defender.** The sidekick can use its reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll of a creature within 5 feet of it whose target isn't the sidekick, provided the sidekick can see the attacker.

### Second Wind

_2nd-level Warrior feature_  
The sidekick can use a bonus action on its turn to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + its level in this class. Once it uses this feature, it must finish a short or long rest before it can use it again.

The sidekick can use this feature twice between rests starting at 20th level

### Improved Critical

_3rd-level Warrior feature_  
The sidekick's attack rolls score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

### Ability Score Improvement

_4th-level Warrior feature_

At 4th level and again at 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two ability scores of your choice by 1. The sidekick can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack

_6th-level Warrior feature_  
The sidekick can attack twice, instead of once, whenever it takes the Attack action on its turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when the sidekick reaches 15th level.

If the sidekick has the Multiattack action, it can use Extra Attack or Multiattack on a turn, not both.

### Battle Readiness

_7th-level Warrior feature_

The sidekick has advantage on initiative rolls.

### Improved Defense

_10th-level Warrior feature_

The sidekick's Armor Class increases by 1.

### Indomitable

_11th-level Warrior feature_

The sidekick can reroll a saving throw that it fails, but it must use the new roll. When it uses this feature, it can't use the feature again until it finishes a long rest.

The sidekick can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 18th level.
