## Description
You endow yourself with endurance and martial prowess fueled by magic.
Until the spell ends, you can't cast spells, and you gain the following benefits:
- You gain 50 temporary hit points.
	If any of these remain when the spell ends, they are lost.
- You have advantage on Attack Rolls that you make with simple and martial weapons.
- When you hit a target with a Weapon Attack, that target takes an extra `2d12` force damage.
- You have proficiency with all armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.
- You have proficiency in Strength and Constitution Saving Throws.
- You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the *attack* action on your turn.
	You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.

Immediately after the spell ends, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw or suffer one level of **exhaustion**.
