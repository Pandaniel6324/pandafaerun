You twist the fates of two creatures you can see, both of whom must be within range. Choose one target to favour and one to disfavour. The disfavoured target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or the following effects occur:

• Whenever the favoured target makes an attack roll or saving throw before the spell ends, the favoured target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack or saving throw 
• Whenever the disfavoured target makes an attack roll or saving throw before the spell ends, the disfavoured target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack or saving throw 
• The disfavoured target’s speed is halved, whilst the favoured target’s speed increases by half

These effects end for the pair if either of the target pair is knocked unconscious, killed, or the spell ends While under the influence of this spell, a favoured tar- get can’t benefit from the [[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Spells/level-1/Bless\|bless]] spell, and a disfavoured target can’t be afflicted by the [[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Spells/level-1/Bane\|bane]] spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can link two other creatures, favouring one, and disfavouring the other, for each two slot levels above 2nd
