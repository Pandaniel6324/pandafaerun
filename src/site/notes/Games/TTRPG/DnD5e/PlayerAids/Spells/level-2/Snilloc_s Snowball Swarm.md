## Description
A flurry of magic snowballs erupts from a point you choose within range.
Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `3d6` cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 2nd.
