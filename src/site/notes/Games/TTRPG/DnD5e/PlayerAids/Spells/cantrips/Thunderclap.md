## Description
You create a burst of thunderous sound that can be heard up to 100 feet away.
Each creature within range, other than you, must make a Constitution Saving Throw or take `1d6` thunder damage.

The spell's damage increases by `1d6` when you reach 5th level (`2d6`), 11th level (`3d6`), and 17th level (`4d6`).
