## Description
A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range.
Make a Ranged Spell Attack against the target.
On a hit, the target takes `2d8` poison damage and must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a failed save, it is also **poisoned** until the end of your next turn.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 1st.
