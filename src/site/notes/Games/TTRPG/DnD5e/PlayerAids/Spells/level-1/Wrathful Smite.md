## Description
The next time you hit with a Melee Weapon Attack during this spell's duration, your attack deals an extra `1d6` psychic damage.
Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Wisdom Saving Throw or be **frightened** of you until the spell ends.
As an action, the creature can make a Wisdom Check against your Spell Save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.
