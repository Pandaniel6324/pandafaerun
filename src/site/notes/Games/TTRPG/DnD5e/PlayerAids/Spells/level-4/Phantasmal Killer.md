## Description
You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature.
The target must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the target becomes **frightened** for the duration.
At the end of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or take `4d10` psychic damage.
On a successful save, the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 4th.
