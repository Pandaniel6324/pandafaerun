## Description
The first time you hit with a Melee Weapon Attack during this spell's duration, your weapon rings with thunder that is audible within 300 feet of you, and the attack deals an extra `2d6` thunder damage to the target.
Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked **prone**.
