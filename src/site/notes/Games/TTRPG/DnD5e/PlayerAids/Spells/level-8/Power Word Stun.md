## Description
You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded.
If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is **stunned**.
Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

The **stunned** target must make a Constitution Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns.
On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.
