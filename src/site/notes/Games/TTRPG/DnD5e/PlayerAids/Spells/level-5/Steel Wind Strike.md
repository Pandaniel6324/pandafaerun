## Description
You flourish the weapon used in the casting and then vanish to strike like the wind.
Choose up to five creatures you can see within range.
Make a Melee Spell Attack against each target.
On a hit, a target takes `6d10` force damage.

You can then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of one of the targets you hit or missed.
