## Description
You attempt to compel a creature into a duel.
One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand.
For the duration, it has disadvantage on Attack Rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom Saving Throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this Saving Throw, this spell doesn't restrict the target's movement for that turn.

The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.
