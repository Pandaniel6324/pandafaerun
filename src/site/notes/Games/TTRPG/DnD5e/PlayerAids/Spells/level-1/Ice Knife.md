## Description
You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range.
Make a Ranged Spell Attack against the target.
On a hit, the target takes `1d10` piercing damage.
Hit or miss, the shard then explodes.
The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or take `2d6` cold damage.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.
