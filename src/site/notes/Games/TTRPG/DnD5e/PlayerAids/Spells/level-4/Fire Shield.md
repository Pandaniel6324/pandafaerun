## Description
Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose.
The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a Melee Attack, the shield erupts with flame.
The attacker takes `2d8` fire damage from a warm shield, or `2d8` cold damage from a cold shield.
