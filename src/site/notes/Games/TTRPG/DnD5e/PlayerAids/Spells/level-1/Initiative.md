As a reaction when initiative is rolled, choose a willing creature you can see within range; it begins to subtly jitter as its pupils dilate. If the target is surprised, it is no longer surprised, and takes its turn on the first round as normal If the target is not surprised, it gains **advantage** on the initiative roll that prompted this spell. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you may target one additional creature for each spell slot above 1st
