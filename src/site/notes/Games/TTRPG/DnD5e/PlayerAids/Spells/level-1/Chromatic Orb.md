## Description
You hurl a 4-inch-diameter sphere of energy at a creature that you can see within range.
You choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder for the type of orb you create, and then make a Ranged Spell Attack against the target.
If the attack hits, the creature takes `3d8` damage of the type you chose.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 1st.
