You fill the air with spinning daggers in a cube 5 feet on each side, centered on a point you choose within range.
A creature takes `4d4` slashing damage when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `2d4` for each slot level above 2nd.
