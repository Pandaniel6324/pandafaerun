## Description
You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range.
The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured.
It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.
