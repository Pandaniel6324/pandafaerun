## Description
Choose one creature you can see within range.
Yellow strips of magical energy loop around the creature.
The target must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw, or its flying speed (if any) is reduced to 0 feet for the spell's duration.
An airborne creature affected by this spell safely descends at 60 feet per round until it reaches the ground or the spell ends.
