## Description
A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid.
Make a Ranged Spell Attack against the target.
On a hit, the target takes `4d4` acid damage immediately and `2d4` acid damage at the end of its next turn.
On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by `1d4` for each slot level above 2nd.
