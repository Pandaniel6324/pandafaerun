## Description
You utter a divine word, and burning radiance erupts from you.
Each creature of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or take `1d6` radiant damage.

The spell's damage increases by `1d6` when you reach 5th level (`2d6`), 11th level (`3d6`), and 17th level (`4d6`).
