## Description
The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns.
The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration.
When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes `2d4` piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural.
Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your Spell Save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
