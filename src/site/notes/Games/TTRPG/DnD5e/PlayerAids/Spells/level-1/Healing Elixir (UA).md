## Description
You create a healing elixir in a simple vial that appears in your hand.
The elixir retains its potency for the duration or until it's consumed, at which point the vial vanishes.

As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to another creature.
The drinker regains `2d4 + 2` hit points.
