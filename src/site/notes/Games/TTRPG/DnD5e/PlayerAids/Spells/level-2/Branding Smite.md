## Description
The next time you hit a creature with a Weapon Attack before this spell ends, the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike.
The attack deals an extra `2d6` radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it's **invisible**, and the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius and can't become **invisible** until the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 2nd.
