## Description
The next time you make a Ranged Weapon Attack during the spell's duration, the weapon's ammunition, or the weapon itself if it's a thrown weapon, transforms into a bolt of lightning.
Make the Attack Roll as normal.
The target takes `4d8` lightning damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon's normal damage.

Whether you hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
Each of these creatures takes `2d8` lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage for both effects of the spell increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 3rd.
