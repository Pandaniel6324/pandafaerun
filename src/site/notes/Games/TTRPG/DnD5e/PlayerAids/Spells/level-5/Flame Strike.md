## Description
A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a location you specify.
Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `4d6` fire damage and `4d6` radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 5th.
