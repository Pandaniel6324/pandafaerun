## Description
A strong wind (20 miles per hour) blows around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you.
The wind lasts for the spell's duration.

The wind has the following effects:
- It **deafens** you and other creatures in its area.
- It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller.
- It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.
- The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.
- The Attack Rolls of Ranged Weapon Attacks have disadvantage if the attacks pass in or out of the wind.
