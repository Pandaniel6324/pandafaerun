## Description
A *large* quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range.
You decide the creature's appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle.
Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed.
The creature uses the statistics for a Riding Horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace.
When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount.
The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.
