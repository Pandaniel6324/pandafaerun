## Description
Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make Charisma Saving Throws.
Whenever a target that fails this Saving Throw makes an Attack Roll or a Saving Throw before the spell ends, the target must roll a `d4` and subtract the number rolled from the Attack Roll or Saving Throw.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
