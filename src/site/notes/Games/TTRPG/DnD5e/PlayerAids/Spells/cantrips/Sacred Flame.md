## Description
Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range.
The target must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or take `1d8` radiant damage.
The target gains no benefit from cover for this Saving Throw.

The spell's damage increases by `1d8` when you reach 5th level (`2d8`), 11th level (`3d8`), and 17th level (`4d8`).
