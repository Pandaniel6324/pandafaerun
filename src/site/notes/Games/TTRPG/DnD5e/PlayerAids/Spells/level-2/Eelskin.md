You cause the skin of a willing creature you touch to produce a slimy, electrified mucous. The creatureâ€™s unarmed strikes and natural weapon attacks become magical for the duration of the spell. The first time the creature hits with an unarmed strike or an attack using a natural weapon on its turn, it deals an additional 1d8 lightning damage as the stored lightning discharges.

**Slimy.** For the duration, the creature has advantage on checks and saves made to avoid being grappled or restrained, and disadvantage on any attempts it makes to grapple another creature.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each two slot levels above 2nd
