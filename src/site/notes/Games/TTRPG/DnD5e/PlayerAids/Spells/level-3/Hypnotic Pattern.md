## Description
You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range.
The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes.
Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the creature becomes **charmed** for the duration.
While **charmed** by this spell, the creature is **incapacitated** and has a speed of 0.

The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
