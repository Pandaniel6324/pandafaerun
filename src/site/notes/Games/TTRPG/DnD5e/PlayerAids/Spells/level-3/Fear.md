## Description
You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst fears.
Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or drop whatever it is holding and become **frightened** for the duration.

While **frightened** by this spell, a creature must take the *dash* action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move.
If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
