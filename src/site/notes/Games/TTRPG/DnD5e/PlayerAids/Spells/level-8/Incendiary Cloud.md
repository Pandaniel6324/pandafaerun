## Description
A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range.
The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured.
It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `10d8` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
A creature must also make this Saving Throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.
