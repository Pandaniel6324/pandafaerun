## Description
Until the spell ends, wind whirls around you, and you gain the following benefits:
- Ranged Weapon Attacks made against you have disadvantage on the Attack Roll.
- You gain a flying speed of 60 feet.
	If you are still flying when the spell ends, you fall, unless you can somehow prevent it.
- You can use your action to create a 15-foot cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you.
	Each creature in that area must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
	A creature takes `2d10` bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	If a *large* or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.
