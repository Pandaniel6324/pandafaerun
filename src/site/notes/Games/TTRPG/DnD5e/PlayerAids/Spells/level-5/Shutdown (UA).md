## Description
This spell shuts down all electronic devices within range that are not wielded by or under the direct control of a creature.
If an electronic device within range is used by a creature, that creature must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw to prevent the device from being shut down.
While the spell remains active, no electronic device within range can be started or restarted.
