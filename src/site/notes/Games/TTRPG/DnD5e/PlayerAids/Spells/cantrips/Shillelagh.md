## Description
The wood of a *club* or *quarterstaff* you are holding is imbued with nature's power.
For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the Attack &amp; Damage Rolls of Melee Attacks using that weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a `d8`.
The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn't already.
The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.
