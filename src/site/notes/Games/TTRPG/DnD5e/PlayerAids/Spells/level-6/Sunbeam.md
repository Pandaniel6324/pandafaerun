## Description
A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line.
Each creature in the line must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes `6d8` radiant damage and is **blinded** until your next turn.
On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't **blinded** by this spell.
Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this Saving Throw.

You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand.
It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
This light is sunlight.
