You call forth a bestial spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the [[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Monsters/Bestial Spirit\|Bestial Spirit]] stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an environment: Air, Land, or Water. The creature resembles an animal of your choice that is native to the chosen environment, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, use the higher level where the spell’s level appears in the stat block.
