## Description
You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you.
Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or take `5d6` thunder damage, as well as `5d6` radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked **prone**.
A creature that succeeds on its Saving Throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked **prone**.
