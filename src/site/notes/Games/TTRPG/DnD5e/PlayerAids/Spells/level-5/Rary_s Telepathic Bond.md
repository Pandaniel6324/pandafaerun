## Description
You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration.
Creatures with Intelligence Scores of 2 or less aren't affected by this spell.

Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language.
The communication is possible over any distance, though it can't extend to other planes of existence.
