## Description
A line of roaring flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose.
Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `3d8` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 2nd.
