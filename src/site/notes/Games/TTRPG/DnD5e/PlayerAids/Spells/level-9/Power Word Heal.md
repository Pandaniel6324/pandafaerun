## Description
A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch.
The target regains all its hit points.
If the creature is **charmed**, **frightened**, **paralyzed**, or **stunned**, the condition ends.
If the creature is **prone**, it can use its reaction to stand up.
This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
