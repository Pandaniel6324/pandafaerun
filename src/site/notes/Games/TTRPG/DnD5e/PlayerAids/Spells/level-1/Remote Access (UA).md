## Description
You can use any electronic device within range as if it were in your hands.
This is not a telekinesis effect.
Rather, this spell allows you to simulate a device's mechanical functions electronically.
You are able to access only functions that a person using the device manually would be able to access.
You can use remote access with only one device at a time.
