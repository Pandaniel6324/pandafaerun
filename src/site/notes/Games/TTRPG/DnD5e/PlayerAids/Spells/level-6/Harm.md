## Description
You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range.
The target must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a failed save, it takes `14d6` necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1.
If the target fails the Saving Throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took.
Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.
