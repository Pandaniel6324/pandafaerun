A willing creature you touch gains a preternatural ability to perceive the weaknesses in a creature’s defenc- es. The first time the creature makes an attack while under the effect of this spell, it makes the attack with advantage. After it makes an attack, the spell ends.

This spell augments the creature’s ability to strike at vital points when you reach certain levels When you reach 5th level, the augmented attack scores a criti- cal hit on a roll of **19** or **20**. At 11th level, this range is increased to **18** to **20**, and at 17th level, this range becomes **17** to **20**.
