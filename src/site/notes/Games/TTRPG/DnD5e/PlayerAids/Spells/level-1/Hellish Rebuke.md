## Description
You point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by hellish flames.
The creature must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
It takes `2d10` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 1st.
