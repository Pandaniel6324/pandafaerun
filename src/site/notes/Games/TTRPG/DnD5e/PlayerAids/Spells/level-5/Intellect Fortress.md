## Description
You create a faintly shimmering barrier of protective psychic power around you.
For the duration, you have advantage on all Saving Throws.

When another creature that you can see within 30 feet of you fails a Saving Throw, you can use your reaction to allow them to reroll the save.
They must use the new roll.
