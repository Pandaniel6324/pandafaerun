## Description
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, divination spells, and the **charmed** condition.
The spell even foils [[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Spells/level-9/Wish\|Wish]] spells and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the target's mind or to gain information about the target.
