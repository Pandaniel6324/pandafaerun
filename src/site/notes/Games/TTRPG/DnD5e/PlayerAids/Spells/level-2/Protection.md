You trace a warding sigil in the air, sending it to slowly circle a willing creature you can see within range for the next hour Immediately before the target next takes damage, except psychic damage, the ward triggers Until the end of the targetâ€™s next turn, it has resistance to all damage excluding psychic, including the triggering damage The warding sigil then disap- pears, and the spell ends on the target.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you may target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd
