Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your [[https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability Scores?expansion=0#toc_20\|https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability Scores?expansion=0#toc_20]], to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.  
  
[[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Items/Hide Armor\|Hide Armor]] This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.  
  
[[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Items/Chain Shirt\|Chain Shirt]] Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.  
  
[[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Items/Scale Mail\|Scale Mail]] This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.  
  
[[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Items/Breastplate\|Breastplate]] This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.  
  
[[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Items/Half Plate\|Half Plate]] Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.
