Characters crossing a frigid tundra might suffer the effects of extreme cold, while a visit to a cloud giant’s castle might subject characters to the effects of high altitude. The following sections provide rules for handling these and other environmental effects.

---

### Dead Magic Zone

A dead magic zone is an area where the fabric of magic is torn. The effect is the same as the[[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Spells/level-8/Antimagic Field\|Antimagic Field]] spell, except that it is permanent and typically covers an area no more than 300 feet in diameter.

### Deep Water

Swimming through deep water (more than 100 feet deep) presents additional challenges because of the water’s pressure and cold temperature. After each hour of swimming in deep water, a creature that lacks a Swim Speed must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Rules/Conditions#Exhaustion\|Conditions#Exhaustion]] level.

---

### Extreme Cold

When the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, a creature exposed to the extreme cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1 [[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Rules/Conditions#Exhaustion\|Conditions#Exhaustion]]  level. Creatures that have Resistance or Immunity to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save.

---

### Extreme Heat

When the temperature is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, a creature exposed to the extreme heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1 [[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Rules/Conditions#Exhaustion\|Conditions#Exhaustion]]  level. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour. Creatures wearing Medium or Heavy armor have Disadvantage on the save. Creatures that have Resistance or Immunity to Fire damage automatically succeed on the save.

---

### Frigid Water

A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/PlayerAids/Rules/Conditions#Exhaustion\|Conditions#Exhaustion]]  level. Creatures with Resistance or Immunity to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save, as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in ice-cold water.

---

### Heavy Precipitation

Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy snowfall is [[Lightly Obscured\|Lightly Obscured]], and creatures in the area have disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames.

---

### High Altitude

Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above sea level is taxing for most creatures because of the reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of determining how long that creature can travel [[Travel Pace\|Travel Pace]].

Creatures can become acclimated to a high altitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation. Creatures can’t become acclimated to elevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native to such environments.
