**_Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs – these common threads unite all dwarves._**

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2.

- **Age.** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.

- **Alignment.** Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.

[[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/DMTools/Traits/Darkvision\|Darkvision]] Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

- **Dwarven Combat Training.** You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.

- **Tool Proficiency.** You gain proficiency with the artisan's tools of your choice: smith's tools, brewer's supplies, or mason's tools.

- **Stonecunning.** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.
