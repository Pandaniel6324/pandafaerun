In the depths of the ocean, amidst the gentle sway of seaweed forests, the merfolk make their home. From the rocky shores where they sun themselves to the shadowy depths where the sunlight cannot reach, merfolk occupy all the extremes of the sea the same way that land-dwellers traverse each mountain and valley. Whether they are guiding sailors through treacherous seas, summoning storms to toss the ocean, or defending their underwater realms from invaders, merfolk are deeply connected to the world both above and below the waves

Hues of the Sea Merfolk are as diverse as the oceans they inhabit. Most have heads and torsos that could be mistaken for human if not for the kelp-like hues of their hair or the glittering traces of scales on their skin, combined with the tail of a fish or the powerful limbs of an octopus. But some merfolk resemble aquatic beasts more strongly, with furred seal-like faces or broad shark-like heads. 

The merfolk body commonly features colors that blend with their surroundings, such as blues, greens, and neutral shades, for both protection and predation. However, vibrant colors are not unusual in tropical environments, and merfolk who live in the darkest depths may sport bioluminescent markings. They may also have webbed fingers, gills, and ventral or dorsal fins in addition to tail fins.

**Kingdoms Beneath the Waves**
Merfolk can be found in diverse aquatic environments, from shallow coastal waters to the deepest parts of the ocean. But they are not confined to saltwater, and many thrive in freshwater environments like rivers and lakes. Like land-dwellers, some merfolk live in small settlements, while others build intricate cities, from sunlit coral palaces to sprawling, deep-sea metropolises. Merfolk societies are equally varied. Some interact regularly with terrans, engaging in trade and diplomacy, while others live so far from land that interactions with non-aquatic beings are rare.
