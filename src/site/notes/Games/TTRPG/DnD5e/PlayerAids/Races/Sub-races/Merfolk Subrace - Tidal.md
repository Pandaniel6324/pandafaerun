Tidal merfolk are unique amongst their kin due to their fixed two-legged form. Each shares
features with one of their bestial aquatic kin: Shark-like merfolk may have a dorsal fin and rows
of sharp teeth, while seal-like merfolk may have sleek fur coats and large, expressive eyes.

Like the tide, these merfolk can come and go from the land as they please, without the need for
transformation. This adaptability makes them the primary bridge between merfolk and
land-dwellers, often serving as ambassadors and vital lines of communication. While there are
communities populated mainly with tidal merfolk, they also commonly live alongside
surface-dwellers in oceanfront cities or with coastal merfolk in the shallows. Due to their
proximity to the shore, they are also the first line of defense standing between their underwater
brethren and any external threats from the land.

**Tidal Wanderer**
You have both a walking speed and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed at
all times. When your Aquatic Affinity feature is applied, it also adds 10 feet to your
walking speed.

**Tidal Defender**
When you select this subrace, choose claws, teeth, or limbs for your unarmed strikes.
Also, choose a damage type: piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning. Additionally, decide
whether to use your Strength or Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls with these
strikes. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 + your chosen ability modifier in damage.
When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against you, you can use your
reaction to make an unarmed strike attack against the attacking creature. Once you use
this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier, you canâ€™t use it again
until you finish a short or long rest.
