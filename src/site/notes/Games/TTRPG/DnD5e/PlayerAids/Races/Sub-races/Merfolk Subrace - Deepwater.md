Deepwater merfolk’s humanoid torsos are joined with the lower halves of cephalopods, such as
octopus or squid. Tales of merfolk summoning storms or calming turbulent seas are generally
inspired by the deepwater merfolk, who possess innate spellcasting abilities with an affinity for
water and weather magic. These abilities position deepwater merfolk as powerful forces in the
maritime world: Either valuable guardians and guides who can ensure safe passage across the
ocean, or deadly threats capable of unleashing the fury of the sea on helpless seafarers.

Deepwater merfolk typically reside in sprawling cities built on the deep seafloor. Bioluminescent
markings are a common trait amongst these creatures — a natural adaptation to the sunless
depths where they dwell. Most deepwater merfolk spend their entire lives in the open ocean, far from the sight of any shore, only encountering land-dwellers when they traverse the sea by
boat.

**Deepwater Magic**
You know the shape water cantrip.
Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the fog cloud spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level,
you can also cast the tidal wave spell with this trait. Once you cast fog cloud or tidal
wave with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You
can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate
level.
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you
cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).

**Tentacular Casting**
You can use your tentacles with as much precision and control as your hands. If a spell
requires a somatic component, you can perform these gestures using your tentacles,
even if your hands are restrained or otherwise unavailable.

**Darkvision**
You have [[Games/TTRPG/DnD5e/DMTools/Traits/Darkvision\|Darkvision]] with a range of 60 feet.
