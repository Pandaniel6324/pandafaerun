## Necromancer

Whether through the tutelage of a lich, a career as a gravedigger, or an innate affinity for the world beyond, you have learnt to manipulate the very essence of life. You can strip it from those that would do you harm, and imbue it in those that serve your aims.

Weaving threads of necromantic magic around bone, flesh, and sinew, you create gruesome facsimiles of life—undead puppets that move to the rhythm of the threads you pull.

### Life Hack  
**3rd-level Necromancer feature**  

Your command of necromantic magic and affinity for the no-longer-living allows you to drain your companion’s life force and convert it into a temporary boon.

Once per turn, when your companion hits a creature with an attack, you can mentally command the companion to shed some of its life force (no action required). Your companion:

- Takes **1d4 necrotic damage** (cannot be reduced),
- Gains an equal number of **temporary hit points**,
- Deals that amount as **bonus necrotic damage** to the target.

This damage increases at higher levels:
- 1d6 at 6th level  
- 1d8 at 10th level  
- 1d10 at 14th level

### Post-Mortem  
**3rd-level Necromancer feature**  

Death is no barrier to your taming magic. You can attempt to tame one creature within 1 minute of it dying, using the normal rules for taming a new companion, with the following change:

- The **creature’s soul** makes a **Charisma saving throw** against your tamer spell save DC

- **Humanoids and giants** don’t automatically succeed on this saving throw.
- **On a failure**: The creature’s soul becomes bound to its body; its type changes to **undead**, and it becomes one of your companions.
- **On a success**: You fail to tame the creature, and you can’t attempt to tame it again until it has been brought back to life by other means.

### Necromancer Spells  
**3rd-level Necromancer feature**  

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Necromancer Spells table. Each spell counts as a tamer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of tamer spells you know.

### Animate Dead  
**7th-level Necromancer feature**  

You learn how to use your taming magic to temporarily raise new allies and bind them to your will.

- You learn the *animate dead* spell.  
- You always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against your number of spells known.  
- You can cast it **once without using a spell slot**. After doing so, you must finish a long rest to cast it this way again.

At 18th level, when you cast this spell using this feature:
- The creature you animate uses the **ghast** stat block if it's a Medium or smaller corpse.  
- It uses the **minotaur skeleton** stat block if it's a Large or larger corpse.

You can control only **1 creature per casting** of the spell, instead of 4.

When you issue a command to your companion (bonus action or action), you can issue the same command to all creatures you animated with *animate dead*, as long as they are within **100 feet** of you.

---

### Enervate  
**10th-level Necromancer feature**  

You learn to channel life force between you and your companions.

As an action, if your summoned companion is within 100 feet:
- You can deal **necrotic damage** to your companion equal to up to **twice your tamer level** (cannot be reduced).
- You regain hit points equal to the damage dealt.

Alternatively:
- You can deal the necrotic damage **to yourself** and restore hit points to your **summoned companion** equal to the damage you took.

---

### Aura of Undeath  
**14th-level Necromancer feature**  

As an action, you tap into necromantic energy, imbuing your companion with a **15-foot aura of undeath** for 1 minute.

While imbued:

- Your companion can use a **bonus action** on its turn to force one creature it can see within the aura to make a **Constitution saving throw** (DC = your tamer spell save DC).
  - On a failure, the creature takes **4d8 necrotic damage**.
  - Your companion gains **temporary hit points equal to half** the damage dealt.

- For the duration, if your companion would be reduced to 0 hit points:
  - It is instead reduced to **1 hit point** and gains **one failed death saving throw**.
  - If it gains **three failed death saves** during the minute (or **five**, if it's undead), it **dies** instantly.

At the **end of the minute**, your companion drops to 0 hit points, falls unconscious, and is **stable**.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a **long rest**.
