## Splicer

Through really tiny stitches, you alter the physiology of your subjec– er… companions, in an unending quest for perfection.  
Many Splicers delve into the world of adventuring in the hopes of discovering exciting new improvements with which to augment their companions.

Your foray into the world of biomancy—whether through wizarding school, working with biosmith artificers, or as the surgical assistant to a mad scientist—has resulted in a singular observation: subjects are much more malleable when they’re psychically bonded to you.

### Augment  
**3rd-level Splicer feature**

You can fiddle with the very essence of your companions, crafting minor improvements and modifications.

- When you choose this paradigm, you gain **3 splicer points**.  
- Each time you gain a level in the tamer class, you gain **1 additional splicer point**.  
- You can spend these points to modify your companions with **augments**—features and traits that take effect when you next finish a long rest.

**Splicer points are shared across all companions.**  
If a companion is released, it loses all augments and the points are refunded.

> Augments can only be taken once unless stated otherwise.

You also gain **proficiency with surgeon’s tools** (see page 121).

- You can spend **1 hour** using your surgeon’s tools to remove all augments from one companion.
- The companion loses all augment effects, and you **regain all splicer points** spent on that companion, which you can reallocate.

### Splicer Spells  
**3rd-level Splicer feature**

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Splicer Spells table. Each spell counts as a tamer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of tamer spells you know.

|-------------|--------|
| 3rd         | *chameleon skin*¹, *disguise self* |
| 5th         | *barkskin*, *eelskin*¹ |

### Modular Upgrades  
**7th-level Splicer feature**

You can upgrade each of your companions with exotic organs and appendages.

- At the **start of a long rest**, you may choose one upgrade per companion.
- At the **end of the long rest**, the biomantic meld completes, and your companion gains the corresponding **action option**.
- The save DC for these abilities is your **tamer spell save DC**.

#### Upgrade Options

##### **Compelling Plumage**:  
  Each creature in a 25-foot cone that can see your companion must make a **Wisdom saving throw** or be **charmed** for 1 minute.  
  While charmed in this way:
  - The creature is **incapacitated** and has a **speed of 0**.
  - The effect ends early if the creature takes damage, if someone uses an action to rouse it, if it loses line of sight to the companion, or if it moves more than 25 feet away.
   
##### **Phosphoburst.** 
Each other creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on your companion must make a Constitution saving throw against the dizzying burst of light your companion emits. On a failure, a creature takes 2d10 radiant damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded.

##### **Poison Web.**
Your companion launches an unfurling web of sticky silk in a 20-foot cube originating from it. All surfaces in the area become lined with webbing for the next minute. Each creature that touches one of these surfaces for the first time on its turn or starts its turn doing so must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained for the duration, or until it breaks free. A creature restrained by the webs takes 2d4 poison damage when it becomes restrained and at the start of each of its turns. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your tamer spell save DC, freeing itself or another creature restrained by this web on a success.

##### *Sirenshriek.** 
Each other creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on your companion must make an Intelligence saving throw as your companion lets forth a brain-curdling mental shriek. On a failure, a creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and, if it is concentrating on a spell, loses its concentration. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and makes saving throws to maintain its concentration as normal.

Once a companion uses one of these actions, it can’t do so again until it finishes a short or long rest. Starting at 18th level, a companion can use this action twice before a rest.

### Battlefield Harvester
*10th-level Splicer feature*

You augment your companions with a highly adaptive mutagen, allowing them to gain the strengths of foes they defeat and confer it to your other companions through a synchronous quantum biomantic link. As an action, you can command your companion to consume the corpse of a non-swarm creature that has been dead for less than 1 minute. Choose one of the consumed creature’s damage resistances, damage immunities, or condition immunities (except immunity to exhaustion). All of your companions gain resistance to one damage type to which the slain creature was resistant or immune, or gain immunity to one condition to which the creature was immune.

After you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. When you use this feature again, your companions lose any benefit they had previously gained from this feature.

### Adrenal Overload
*14th-level Splicer feature*

As an action, you trigger a hidden, internal switch within your companion, triggering a cascade of rapid mutations that lasts for the next minute, with the following results:

*   It immediately grows to Huge size (if it isn’t already).
*   Its weight increases by a factor of 8 per size category increased.
*   It gains temporary hit points equal to ten times your tamer level.
*   Its Strength score increases to 22 (if it isn’t already higher).
*   It gains proficiency in the Athletics skill.
*   It sprouts an appendage with which it can make melee weapon attacks with a reach of 5 feet that deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice when you take the action) equal to 3d6 plus its Strength modifier (+6) on a hit.
*   It gains the Multiattack action option: The companion makes three attacks with its appendage.

After the minute elapses, your companion falls unconscious for 1d4 hours and gains 2 levels of exhaustion. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
