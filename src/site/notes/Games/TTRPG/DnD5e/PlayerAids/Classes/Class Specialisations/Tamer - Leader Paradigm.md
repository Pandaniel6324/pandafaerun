## Leader

Whether it be through a non-stop litany of encouraging aphorisms, exaggerated movements, and hand signals, or through a calm, telepathic reinforcement, a leader exhorts their companions to ever greater feats of brilliance.

Leaders believe that with the right support and teamwork, no task is impossible for their menagerie of companions. Whether you swear by positive reinforcement, craft meticulous pre-fight gameplans, or ruthlessly punish mistakes, communication and motivation are your watchwords.

### Inspire  
**3rd-level Leader feature**  

As an action, you can inspire your companion through shouts, gestures, and mental encouragement. Until the beginning of your next turn, whenever your companion makes a saving throw or attack roll, it can add a **d6** to its result.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Tamer spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

The die you grant when you use this feature changes when you reach certain levels in this class:  
- At 6th level: **d8**  
- At 10th level: **d10**  
- At 14th level: **d12**

### Leader Spells  
**3rd-level Leader feature**  

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Leader Spells table. Each spell counts as a Tamer spell for you, but doesn’t count against the number of Tamer spells you know.

### Action Burst  
**7th-level Leader feature**  

You can push your companion beyond its normal limits for a moment. When you use an action or bonus action to command your companion, you can extol it to exert greater effort. On your companion’s turn, it can take one additional action of your choice.

Once your companion has benefited from your use of this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before that same companion can benefit from it again.

Starting at 18th level, your companions can benefit from Action Burst **twice** before a rest, but only **once** on the same turn.

---

### Leader’s Fortitude  
**10th-level Leader feature**  

When an attacker that you can see hits your companion with an attack, you can use both your and your companion’s reactions to bolster its resilience. Your companion fortifies itself, **halving the attack’s damage** against it.

---

### Combo  
**14th-level Leader feature**  

As an action, you can summon a second companion from a vessel you are holding to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you.

When you use an action or bonus action to command your companion, you can command **both** of them simultaneously, giving a different command to each. The two companions take their turns in an order of your choice, directly after your turn.

At the start of their turns, you can mentally choose one creature you can see (no action required). If your first companion makes an attack against the chosen target, the second companion gains **advantage** on its attack rolls against this creature until the end of its turn.

After being summoned for 1 minute, or if your second companion is ever more than 100 feet away from you, the second companion is dismissed.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
