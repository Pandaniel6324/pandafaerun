## Infuser

Infusers meld the power of the elements with their companions through the act of summoning. How you came across this power is anyone’s guess. Perhaps you took a tumble across the Elemental Flux during an inter-planar voyage, were born with some primordial heritage, or were tutored by an elementalist wizard. However it happened, you have the ability to empower those with which you are most closely bonded: your companions.

### Infuse  
**3rd-level Infuser feature**  

You have a deep connection with the elements and can infuse your companions with primordial energy. When you finish a long rest, you can choose one of the following elements with which to individually infuse each of your companions: **acid, cold, fire**, or **lightning**. When you do so, any previous infusion on those companions ends.

The first time your companion hits a target with an attack on its turn, it deals additional damage of the infused type:

- 1d4 damage at 3rd level  
- 1d6 damage at 6th level  
- 1d8 damage at 10th level  
- 1d10 damage at 14th level

### Infuser Spells  
**3rd-level Infuser feature**  

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infuser Spells table. Each spell counts as a tamer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of tamer spells you know.

### Elemental Discharge  
**7th-level Infuser feature**  

Your companions gain the ability to unleash a torrent of elemental energy in a devastating blow. When you infuse a companion at the end of a long rest, it gains an action option corresponding to the chosen element. The DC for these saving throws equals your tamer spell save DC.

- **Acid – Caustic Mist**: 20-foot cube of acidic vapour lasting 1 minute or until dispersed by strong wind. Creatures starting their turn in the area must succeed a Constitution saving throw or take **4d4 acid damage** (half on success).

- **Cold – Snap Freeze**: 10-foot-radius sphere. Each creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On failure: **4d8 cold damage** and speed halved. On success: half damage, no speed penalty.

- **Fire – Flametongue**: 25-foot cone. Each creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking **6d6 fire damage** on failure (half on success). Flammable objects ignite.

- **Lightning – Sparkstep**: 10-foot-radius sphere. Each creature makes a Dexterity saving throw. On failure: **4d6 lightning damage** and no reactions until start of its next turn. On success: half damage, reactions as normal. After resolving saves, the companion may fly up to 30 feet as part of the action.

Once a companion uses this feature, it can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.  
Starting at 18th level, a companion can use this action **twice** before a rest, but only once per turn.

---

### Primordial Shield  
**10th-level Infuser feature**  

Your companion gains **resistance** to the element it is infused with.  
When your companion takes damage of that type, you can use your **reaction** to grant it **immunity** to that damage type (including the triggering damage) until the start of your next turn.

Once you use this reaction, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

---

### Unstable Fusion  
**14th-level Infuser feature**  

Sometimes, more is better. As an action, you can infuse your companion with a **second element** for 1 minute. Choose an additional element from the *Infuse* feature.

Your companion gains the effects of **Infuse**, **Elemental Discharge**, and **Primordial Shield** for **both** elements.  
If you activate your **Primordial Shield** while *Unstable Fusion* is active, your companion gains **immunity** to both damage types.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
