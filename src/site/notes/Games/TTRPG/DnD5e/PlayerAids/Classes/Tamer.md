# Tamer

Flourishing a gilded skull snatched from within the folds of a cloak, a dwarf summons a fierce-eyed angel in a flare of blinding radiance, emphatically encouraging it to fantastical feats of fury.

Beaming from ear to ear, a chemical-stained gnome admires her handiwork amongst the clutter of her laboratory: a ‘snektopus’; eight venom-fanged maws perfectly spliced with the intelligence of a cephalopod.

Coughing in the smoking ruins of the cultists’ former hideout, a tiefling gives their fire-infused owlbear a playful rub behind the ears, contemplating a job well done and the rewards to be claimed.

Whether imbuing their companions with the primordial elements, enhancing them through the ‘very tiny stitches’ of biomancy, or inciting them with words of encouragement, tamers work through their captured friends. Alone, a tamer possesses little in the way of destructive ability. With carefully selected companions, a tamer can become an unstoppable menagerie of mayhem.

## Creating a Tamer

What prompted you to begin taming creatures? Loneliness? A need to transport your favourite dragonling through customs? A pathological desire to catch ‘em all?

The bond tamers experience with their companions are incredibly intimate; both are privy to the other’s innermost thoughts. However, such bonds differ between tamers: where one tamer might view a companion as friend and equal, another might view the creature as a tool with which to fulfill their own goals. Have you lost a companion before? How did you react? Perhaps it was emotionally traumatising, or perhaps it was simply a mere inconvenience.

### Quick Build

You can make a tamer by following this suggestion: Choose **Wisdom**, **Intelligence**, or **Charisma** to be your highest ability score, followed by **Constitution**.

### Optional Rule: Multiclassing

If using the optional rule on multiclassing, use the following prerequisites, proficiencies, and spell slots if you choose the tamer as one of your classes.

- **Ability Score Minimum:** As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you’re already a tamer. The ability you use to qualify to multiclass into tamer must be your tamer spellcasting ability.

## Pocket Familiar *(1st-level Tamer Feature)*

You become bonded to a companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a Small or smaller creature with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that isn’t a humanoid, giant, or swarm to become your companion. When a creature becomes your companion, it has a maximum number of hit points equal to the average of its Hit Dice, as indicated in its statistics, and it can’t cast spells. Work with your GM to find a companion that suits your campaign world. This companion obeys your commands and is friendly to you and your allies.

 **Vessel**
When not summoned, your companion exists inside a magical vessel of your own design, such as a painted animal skull, bejewelled egg, or crystal sphere. While in this vessel, the companion has full cover from all attacks and other effects, is unaffected by area effects that originate from outside the vessel, and exists in stasis; it doesn’t need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe, and it is **immune** to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralised. A companion at 0 hit points is instantly stabilised when it enters its vessel.

If a vessel is broken, or a companion is released from its vessel for any other reason, the creature within it ceases to be a tamer’s companion. It acts according to its own wishes and retains any improvements it gained while a companion.

> **Home Planes**  
> Some magical effects, like the *banishment* spell, have the ability to permanently banish a creature back to its home plane. When a creature becomes your companion, its home plane becomes the demiplane within its vessel. If the companion becomes permanently banished by such a spell, it simply reappears in this vessel.

**Summoning**
As an action, you can summon your companion from a vessel, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you, or any unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You can dismiss a companion within 30 feet of you as a bonus action or action, drawing it back into its vessel. To summon or dismiss a companion, you must be holding its vessel in hand. You can only have one companion summoned at a time.

> **Dominated Companions**  
> A companion that is controlled by another creature, such as by the *dominate monster* spell, can try to resist being recalled into its vessel. When you try to recall such a creature into its vessel, it can make a **Charisma saving throw** against your tamer spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, it is recalled, while on a success, it is not.

**Combat**
In combat, your companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the **Dodge** action, unless you take a bonus action or action on your turn to command it to take different actions. Those actions can be in its statistics or some other action, bonus action, or object interaction. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. Your companion can’t take the Multiattack action until you reach 5th level in this class, even if it would otherwise be able to.

**Rest**
A companion gains the benefits of a long rest when its tamer finishes a long rest; if it has at least 1 hit point, it regains all its hit points when you finish a long rest. Unlike other creatures, a companion can’t spend its own Hit Dice to recover hit points at the end of a short rest. See the Soul Bond feature for details on recovering hit points.

**Items**
Armour, barding, and weapons can be equipped to enhance your companion. A companion can wear or carry any equipment that their size and body shape permits. However, your companion must be proficient with the armour or weapon to make full use of it. If your companion wears armour that it lacks proficiency with, it has **disadvantage** on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity. A companion that is not proficient with a weapon type does not add its proficiency bonus to attack rolls made with that weapon type.

**Item Bonding**
Over the course of an hour, you can bond a companion to one object that it can wear or carry that is not any sort of container or storage. When a companion is recalled, all items it is wearing or carrying that it is not bonded to are dropped in the space from which it was recalled.

- A companion can be bonded to up to **3 items** at any one time.
    
- Companions **can’t attune to magic items**, unless they have a specific ability that allows them to do so (e.g. _Proto-Attunement_, page 242).
    

## Companion Barding

You can purchase armour for your companion. Any type of armour can be purchased as barding.

- The cost and weight is **doubled for each size category above Medium**, and **halved for each size category below Small**.
    
- If the companion is not humanoid in shape, the cost is **further doubled**.
    

### Companion Barding Cost Table

|Size|Humanoid Shape Cost|Abstract Shape Cost|
|---|---|---|
|Tiny|0.5x|1x|
|Small|1x|2x|
|Medium|1x|2x|
|Large|2x|4x|
|Huge|4x|8x|

---

## Soul Bond _(1st-level Tamer feature)_

- Companions make **death saving throws**, can **die**, and can be **revived like any player character**.
    
- A companion that has been stabilised remains unconscious until it regains hit points, or until you finish a long rest.
    
- Companions that are stable and have 0 hit points when you finish a long rest regain **half their maximum hit points**.
    
- You have a **pool of healing power** equal to **five times your tamer level**, replenished after a long rest.
    
- After a short rest, you can draw from this pool to restore hit points to your companions, up to the pool’s current total.
    

---

## Monster Trainer _(1st-level Tamer feature)_

As you gain levels in this class, your companions become more powerful.

- Companions use **your proficiency bonus** instead of their own, improving their attacks, saves, skill checks, and save DCs.
    

---

**Training**
Whenever you gain an **Ability Score Improvement**, all your bonded companions gain the following:

- **+1 Hit Die**. Increase their hit point maximum by rolling this die and adding the companion’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 0).
    

Additionally, whenever you gain a level beyond 1st, each companion bonded to you gains **one improvement**. Familiars from Chapter 8 may receive unique options instead.

### Companion Improvement Options

- **Speed Training**  
    Increase one existing speed by **15 feet**, up to a max of **150%** of the creature’s base speed (rounded up to nearest 5).
    
- **Toughen Up**  
    Gain an additional Hit Die and increase the hit point maximum accordingly.
    
- **Ability Boost**  
    Increase one of your companion’s ability scores by 1 (max 20).
    
- **Go For the Throat**  
    Gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with **natural weapons or unarmed strikes**.
    
    > **Note**:  
    > Each companion can benefit from this once.
    
    - At Tamer level 5: max of 2 uses.
        
    - At Tamer level 9: max of 3 uses.
        
- **Survival Instincts**  
    Gain proficiency in **one saving throw**.
    
- **War Training**  
    Gain proficiency in **one armour type** or **two weapons**.
    
    > **Note**: Companions must follow prerequisites:  
    > Must take **light → medium → heavy** in order.
